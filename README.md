# BMI

Write a C++ program that calculates a person’s Body Mass Index (BMI). The height and weight should be hardcoded in imperial units (pounds and inches). 
The program must convert them into metric units (kilograms and meters) before calculating BMI.
Use these numbers: 

int height = 61;
int weight= 130;

Use these formulas to convert to the metric system:

Convert pounds to kilograms:
kg = pounds×0.453592

Convert inches to meters:
m=inches×0.0254

Use this formula for BMI: 
<img width="202" height="95" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80f6f9af-6879-4a4d-a61b-ab2928e82be0" />

The program should output:

"The BMI for this person is :  24.56."
